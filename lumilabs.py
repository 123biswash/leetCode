# Given a log file with each row representing <user_id> <page_url>, write a method to return 10 most common triplets. A triplet is defined as a collection of 3 pages visited in a consecutive sequence by a user. So if there are 5 pages: A, B,C, D, E and following log file:
# 
# 1 A
# 1 B
# 2 B
# 3 A
# 2 C
# 1 C
# 1 D
# 1 E
# 2 D
# 2 A
# 2 E
# 
# Then the most common triplet is: BCD since itâ€™s visited by both 1 and 2.
# 
# #max number of users. make that many arrays to store each user's website visits consecutively
